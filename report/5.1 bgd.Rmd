## Batch Gradient Descent 
Batch gradient descent (BGD) updates the parameters $\theta$ after computing the gradient on the entire training set. This is the key difference between batch gradient descent and its variants. 

The advantage of computing the gradient on the entire dataset is that it produces a better, more stable approximation of the gradient. 

On the other hand, batch gradient descent has its challenges:    

* The stability of the gradient may result in a suboptimal state of convergence when local minimums or saddle points are encountered. A more noisy gradient can enable the algorithm to escape saddle points or subvert local minima.     
* Computing the gradient on the entire dataset often results in a slower convergence, especially for large datasets.    
* Batch gradient descent requires the entire dataset to be memory resident, which can be problematic for large datasets.   
* Classic batch gradient descent works on a constant learning rate for all iterations of the search. Ideally, we would like a learning rate to adapt to the contours of our objective function. Many textbook optimization algorithms use analytic approaches, such as Newton's method, to determine the exact step size. However, the computation can be too expensive to be used in the context of large neural networks. Most practitioners simply fix it to a constant or slowly decay it over iterations. Determining optimal learning rates is an area of open research.

In the following sections, we will review the algorithm, implement a basic batch gradient descent class, perform hyperparameter tuning using a gridsearch, then evaluate algorithm behavior for select hyperparameter sets. 

### Algorithm
Batch gradient descent, starts with an initial $\theta$ and performs the following recursive update rule:
$$\theta_j^{k+1} := \theta_j^k - \alpha \nabla_\theta J,$$
for $k$ iterations until approximate convergence condition or a preset maximum number of iterations is reached.
The pseudocode for the algorithm looks like this. 
```{r eval=F, echo=T, tidy=F}
Standardize our data
Initialize hyperparameters  
While stopping condition is not met 
  h = predict(data, thetas)
  c = costs(h, y, data)
  g = gradient(costs, data)
  thetas = update(thetas, learning_rate, gradient)
return (thetas)
```

### Implementation
Now, we will build the batch gradient descent class that will be used to solve our challenge problem. Before we start getting our code on, let's establish a few design considerations.

#### Design Considerations   
Our GradientDescent class will need the following methods:    

* hypothesis - computes the hypothesis given $X$ and the parameters, $\theta$.     
* cost - computes the cost given $y$ and our hypotheses.     
* gradient - calculates the gradient based upon error and the values $X_j$ for each $j$.      
* update - computes the updates to the $\theta$'s in the direction of greatest descent.    
* fit - conducts the search until stopping conditions are met     

We will support the following learning rate schedules:   

* constant learning rate, value = 'c',        
* time decay learning rates, value = 't',       
* step decay learning rates, value = 's',          
* exponential decay learning rates, value = 'e'.          

Therefore, we will need a method which updates the learning rate on each epoch accordingly. 

With respect to stopping criteria, we would want to stop the algorithm when one or more of the following conditions are met:    

* The number of iterations has reached a preset maximum,     
* Convergence hasn't improved in $i_{stop}$ consecutive iterations.

Convergence is checked once per epoch. If no validation set is provided, training set costs will be the metric by which we determine whether improvement is extant.  If a validation set is provided, our metric will be validation set mean squared error. The improvement in convergence is evaluated with a precision parameter $\epsilon$.

Lastly, since we will be building SGD and Minibatch Gradient Descent classes, we may want to create an abstract base class that contains the core functions used in the computation.

Ok, here we go.

#### Class Initialization
Let's initialize our abstract base class and concrete class for batch gradient descent. We may as well import some packages that we will need.
```{python class_init, echo=T, eval=F}
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import datetime
import math
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd


class GradientDescent(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
      pass
      
class BGD(GradientDescent):
    def __init__(self):
      pass    
```

Now, lets define the base classes that will be inherited by the specific batch, stochastic, and mini-batch implementations.

#### Hypothesis Method
Recall that our linear hypothesis is:
$$h_\theta(x)=\theta_0x_0+\theta_1x_1=X^T \theta.$$
Thus our hypothesis method would simply be the dot product of our inputs $X^T$ and $\theta$. We can easily compute the dot product as follows.
```{python hypothesis_bgd, echo=T, eval=F}
def _hypothesis(self, X, theta):
        return(X.dot(theta))
```

#### Error Method
Since we'll need the error for both the cost and gradient computation, let's create a method that implements:
$$e=h_\theta(x)-y$$
Taking the hypothesis from the previous method and y, we have:
```{python error_bgd, echo=T, eval=F}
def _error(self, h, y):
        return(h-y)
```

#### Cost Method
Recall our cost function is:
$$J(\theta)=\frac{1}{2m}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^m(h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2$$
Our method simply takes half of the mean squared error as follows:
```{python cost_bgd, echo=T, eval=F}
def _cost(self, e):
        return(1/2 * np.mean(e**2))
```

#### MSE Method
This method computes validation set error. For regression our metric will be mean squared error, computed as:    
$$MSE=\frac{1}{m}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^m(h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2$$
Therefore, our validation set MSE method is as follows:
```{python mse, echo=T, eval=F}
def _mse(self, X, y, theta):
    h = self._hypothesis(X, theta)
    e = self._error(h,y)
    return(np.mean(e**2))
```

#### Gradient Method
Next, we compute the gradient from:
$$
\nabla_\theta J =\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j}J(\theta)  = \frac{1}{m}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})\cdot x^{(i)}_j \quad\quad \text{for every j}
$$
Note, $x_0^{(i)}$ for each $i$ is 1 - convenience to simplify our computation. 

This is a vector valued function. This means that it returns a vector of size $n$, where $n$ is the number of parameters in $X$. This the direction of steepest ascent in the objective function.
```{python gradient_bgd, echo=T, eval=F}
def _gradient(self, X, e):
        return(X.T.dot(e)/X.shape[0])
```

#### Parameter Update Method
Our update function, you recall, looks like this.
$$\theta_j^{k+1} := \theta_j^k - \alpha \nabla_\theta J$$
Our update method is therefore:
```{python update_bgd, echo=T, eval=F}
def _update(self, theta, learning_rate, gradient):
        return(theta-(learning_rate * gradient))
```


#### Update Learning Rate Method
This method updates the learning rate in accordance with the learning rate hyperparameters.
```{python update_learning_rate, echo=T, eval=F}
def _update_learning_rate(self, learning_rate_init, learning_rate_schedule, learning_rate, 
                          time_decay, step_decay, step_epochs, exp_decay, epoch):

    if learning_rate_sched == 'c':  # Constant learning rate
        learning_rate_new = learning_rate
    elif learning_rate_sched == 't':  # Time decay learning rate
        learning_rate_new = learning_rate_init/(1+time_decay*epoch)            
    elif learning_rate_sched == 's':  # Step decay learning rate
        learning_rate_new = learning_rate_init*math.pow(step_decay, math.floor((1+epoch)/step_epochs))
    elif learning_rate_sched == 'e':  # Exponential decay learning rate
        learning_rate_new = learning_rate_init * math.exp(-exp_decay*epoch)
    return(learning_rate_new)
```

#### Finished Method
This method determines when the algorithm should stop. The algorithm stops of a maximum number of iterations has been reached, or there has been no improvement in the objective function over $i_{stop}$ iterations in a row.

```{python, finished, echo=T, eval=F}
def _finished(self, state, maxiter, precision, improvement):
    if state['iteration'] == maxiter:
        return(True)        
    if abs(state['prior']-state['current']) < precision:
        self._iter_no_change += 1
        if self._iter_no_change >= improvement:
            return(True)
        else:
            return(False)
    else:
        self._iter_no_change = 0   
        return(False)

```


we will also have a method that updates the state dictionary on each iteration. 
```{python, update_state, echo=T, eval=F}
def _update_state(self,state, cross_validated, iteration, J, mse):
    state['iteration'] = iteration
    state['prior'] = state['current']
    if cross_validated:
        state['current'] = mse
    else:
        state['current'] = J
    return(state)
```

Now, we can define the fit method for our BGD class.

#### Fit Method
Finally, the workhorse of our algorithm. 
```{python fit_bgd, echo=T, eval=F}
class BGD(GradientDescent):
  def __init__(self):
      pass

  def fit(self, X, y, theta, X_val=None, y_val=None, learning_rate=0.01, 
          learning_rate_sched = 'c', time_decay=None, step_decay=None,
          step_epochs=None, exp_decay=None, maxiter=0, precision=0.001, 
          no_improvement_stop=5, scaler='minmax'):
             
      # Initialize search variables
      iteration = 0
      self._iter_no_change = 0
      
      # Initialize State 
      state = {'prior':1, 'current':10, 'iteration':0}
      
      # Set cross-validated flag if validation set included 
      cross_validated = all(v is not None for v in [X_val, y_val])        
      
      while not self._finished(state):
          iteration += 1
          mse = None

          # Compute the costs and validation set error (if required)
          h = self._hypothesis(X, theta)
          e = self._error(h, y)
          J = self._cost(e)
          if cross_validated:
              mse = self._mse(X_val, y_val, theta)            

          # Compute gradient
          g = self._gradient(X, e)

          # Update thetas 
          theta = self._update(theta, learning_rate, g)

          # Update learning rate
          learning_rate = self._update_learning_rate(learning_rate_init=learning_rate_init, 
                          learning_rate_schedule=learning_rate_schedule, 
                          learning_rate=learning_rate, time_decay=time_decay, 
                          step_decay=step_decay, step_epochs=step_epochs, 
                          exp_decay=exp_decay, epoch=iteration)

          # Update state vis-a-vis training set costs and validation set mse 
          state = self._update_state(state, iteration, J, mse)

      d = dict()
      d['theta'] = theta
      d['J'] = J
      d['mse'] = mse
  
      return(d)
```

Once we've initialized some variables, we iteratively:    

1. compute training set cost, gradient, and validation set MSE if cross_validated      
2. update the thetas     
3. update the learning rate according to the learning rate schedule  
4. update the state variables

Once convergence criteria are met, we return our thetas and costs.

That's it, for the most part. The complete class definitions are available at https://github.com/DecisionScients/GradientDescent.

Next, we will learn how to set the hyperparameters that will determine algorithm performance.

### Tuning Batch Gradient Descent
Our hyperparameters for batch gradient descent are:  

* **Initial condition hyperparameters**:    
    - initial weight parameters $\theta$     
* **learning rate hyperparameters**:    
    - learning rate $\alpha$, this will be the initial learning rate for learning rate schedules    
    - learning rate schedule, which can be:      
        * 'c' for constant learning rate,    
        * 't' for time decay learning rates,      
        * 's' for step decay learning rates, and      
        * 'e' for exponential decay learning rates
    - other learning rate hyperparameters such as:     
        * time_decay: the parameter that determines the amount the learning rate decays on each iteration,     
        * step_decay: the parameter that determines the amount the learning rate decays on each step,     
        * step_epochs: the parameter that specifies the number of epochs in each step,     
        * exp_decay: the amount of exponential decay to apply to the learning rate on each iteration.     

* **stopping condition hyperparameters**:
    - precision parameter $\epsilon$ by which we evaluate whether a quantum, e.g. training set costs, has changed,   
    - $i_{stop}$, the algorithm stops when the number of consecutive iterations of no improvement equals $i_{stop}$.

Of the hyperparameters listed above, the learning rate related hyperparameters have the greatest effect on performance. We will therefore use a gridsearch strategy to create candidate functions $f_\theta(x)$ for a range of learning rate schedules and learning rates. The initial $\theta$'s, precision parameter, maxiter, $\epsilon$ and the $i_{stop}$, a.k.a. the no improvement stop parameter will be set to their default values and  adjusted as needed. 

#### Data Preparation
As stated above, our training set is comprised of 500 observations, randomly selected from the Ames Housing Project Training Set. The remaining 960 observations in the Ames Housing Project Training Set will be allocated to our validation set. 

So, let's grab our data. We have a small function that was created to randomly sample the training data and split it into the appropriate training and validation sets.
```{python bgd_gs_data, echo=T, eval=T}
X, X_val, y, y_val = data.demo(n=500)
```

Gradient descent is sensitive to feature scaling so let's scale our data to the range [0,1] using sklearn's preprocessing module.
```{python bgd_scale, echo=T, eval=F}
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)
X_val = scaler.fit_transform(X_val)
y = scaler.fit_transform(y)
y_val = scaler.fit_transform(y_val)
```

With that, we are ready to start the tuning process. Let's begin with a learning rate test.

#### Learning Rate Test
What is a learning rate test and why would we conduct one? As we seek to find an optimal constant learning rate, we need an upper bound on the learning rates to evaluate. This upper bound is the maximum learning rate that still improves performance of the objective function. This maximum also serves as our initial learning rate when performing time, step, or exponential learning rate annealing. 

So, let's fix our initial $\theta$'s, precision parameter $\epsilon$, and $i_{stop}$, a.k.a. no_improvement_stop parameter to their default values. We will evaluate a range of learning rates from 0 to 2 incrementing by 0.01.

```{python bgd_learning_rate_test_params, echo=T, eval=T}
theta = np.array([-1,-1]) 
learning_rate_sched = ['c']
learning_rate = np.arange(0,2, 0.01)
precision = [0.001]
maxiter = 5000
no_improvement_stop=[5]
```
We will stop the algorithm when we observe 5 consecutive iterations with no improvement in the objective function computed on the training set. 

With that we can run our gridsearch on our learning rates to determine the maximum learning rate that improves performance of the objective function. A class,  BGDLab, was created to perform our gridsearch. Let's instantiate the class, run the gridsearch and obtain some diagnostic information. 
```{python bgd_learning_rate_test, echo=T, eval=T, cache=T}
lab = BGDLab() 
lab.gridsearch(X=X, y=y, X_val=X_val, y_val=y_val, theta=theta, learning_rate=learning_rate, 
               learning_rate_sched=learning_rate_sched, time_decay=None, 
               step_decay=None, step_epochs=None, exp_decay=None,
               precision=precision, maxiter=maxiter, no_improvement_stop=no_improvement_stop)
```

Now, let's evaluate our training set costs and computation time vis-a-vis learning rate. 
```{python bgd_learning_rate_test_plot, echo=F, eval=T, cache=T}
filename = 'Batch Gradient Descent - Learning Rate Test - Costs.png'
lab.figure(data=lab.summary(), x='learning_rate', y='final_costs', 
           func=lab.lineplot, directory=directory, 
           filename=filename, width=0.5)  
filename = 'Batch Gradient Descent - Learning Rate Test - Time.png'
lab.figure(data=lab.summary(), x='learning_rate', y='duration', 
           func=lab.lineplot, directory=directory, 
           filename=filename, width=0.5)           
```
![](../report/figures/BGD/Lab/Batch Gradient Descent - Learning Rate Test - Costs.png){width=50%}![](../report/figures/BGD/Lab/Batch Gradient Descent - Learning Rate Test - Time.png){width=50%}

`r kfigr::figr(label = "bgd_constant_alpha_plots_i", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")`: Batch Gradient Descent Learning Rate Test 

Training set costs in `r kfigr::figr(label = "bgd_constant_alpha_plots_i", prefix = TRUE, link = TRUE, type="Figure")` indicate divergence at a learning rate $\alpha \approx 1.6$. We'll use this as our upper bound for constant learning rates and our initial learning rate for our annealing learning rate schedules.  

Next, let's tune our constant learning rate.

```{r sgd, child = '5.1.1 bgd constant.Rmd'}
```

```{r sgd, child = '5.1.2 bgd time.Rmd'}
```

```{r sgd, child = '5.1.3 bgd step.Rmd'}
```

```{r sgd, child = '5.1.4 bgd exp.Rmd'}
```

### Batch Gradient Descent Key Takeaways
We've introduced the batch gradient descent optimization algorithm, implemented a basic batch gradient descent class, tuned a range of hyperparameters, most important of which, the learning rate and we've analyzed the effects of various learning rate schedules on empirical and expected performance. Before we take on Stochastic Gradient Descent, let's briefly summarize the key ideas and takeaways with respect to batch gradient descent. 

* Batch gradient descent, distinct from its variants, computes the gradient on the entire dataset on each iteration. This can present both advantages and challenges. On one hand, batch gradient descent typically produces better, more stable approximation of the gradient. On the other hand, the stability in the gradient may can cause the algorithm to converge to a suboptimal solution, especially for non-convex problems or those with saddle points and multiple local minima.
* For large datasets batch gradient descent may be slow to converge, computationally intractable, and memory intensive. 

* Like most machine learning algorithms, batch gradient descent requires tuning of the hyperparameters that govern:
    - how (and where) the algorithm starts: this would include our initial $\theta$'s
    - how the algorithm learns, e.g. learning rates,      
    - when the algorithm stops. stopping conditions balance available computation resources and restrictions with the desire to give the optimization problem ample time to find its optimal solution.
    
* We spent a fair amount of time tuning and analyzing various learning rates and learning rate schedules.
